### **Project Overview**

This repository contains multiple fine-tuning pipelines and evaluation workflows for building transformer-based sarcasm detection model.


### SalsaSarcasm.ipynb

Builds a dataset-specific model:

***Finetuned_Salsa*** is trained using a single English sarcasm dataset.
Used to compare pure single-dataset performance versus multi-dataset training.



### How to Use This Project:

This project includes Google Colab notebooks for fine-tuning and evaluating RoBERTa-base sarcasm detection models. To reproduce the experiments or run the code, please follow the instructions below.
